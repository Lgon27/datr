# datr
This project was inspired by my innability to decide on date ideas for my girlfriend and I. As a result
I decided that the best way to fix this problem was to automate it.

# project details
The premise of this software is to create an application that stores potential date ideas and later chooses
a date for you based on price and distance. Additionally it should also provide suggestions for dining.

# learning goals
This project is partly oriented to allow me to learn more about python syntax and libraries. In the past i've worked on smaller projects using python. However, this is my first
time diving into application development with python.



# future goals
The initial scope of this project is limited to a simple command line application that stores date and dining data locally.
In the future it might be expanded to allow online storage and backup of this data. 
Ultimately the end goal of this project would be to incorporate some kind of technology or algorithm that identifies date ideas
automatically without the user having to enter their own.
